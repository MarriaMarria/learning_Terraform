$ terraform plan -out=newplan

# Saving an execution plan with the out flag ensures your terraform apply operation runs the exact plan rather than applying new changes you may not have approved.

after terraform apply "newplan" we can run terraform show to see the new values associated with the resource group (eg see the changes)

## to create a VM we have to first crreate the following resources:

Resource group
Virtual network
Subnet
Network security group
Network interface
Your deployment will also include a public IP address as well as an explicitly opened port 22 for SSH access.
